An outlier is an observation that lies an abnormal distance from other values
in a random sample from a population.

The box plot uses the median and the lower and upper quartiles (defined as the
25th and 75th percentiles). If the lower quartile is Q1 and the upper quartile
is Q3, then the difference (Q3 - Q1) is called the interquartile range or IQ.

A box plot is constructed by drawing a box between the upper and lower quartiles
with a solid line drawn across the box to locate the median. The following
quantities (called fences) are needed for identifying extreme values in the tails
of the distribution:
1) lower inner fence: Q1 - 1.5*IQ
2) upper inner fence: Q3 + 1.5*IQ
3) lower outer fence: Q1 - 3*IQ
4) upper outer fence: Q3 + 3*IQ

A point beyond an inner fence on either side is considered a mild outlier.
A point beyond an outer fence is considered an extreme outlier.

Outliers should be investigated carefully. Often they contain valuable information
about the process under investigation or the data gathering and recording process.
Before considering the possible elimination of these points from the data, one
should try to understand why they appeared and whether it is likely similar values
will continue to appear. Of course, outliers are often bad data points.
