The iris dataset is a classification task consisting in identifying 3 different
types of irises (Setosa, Versicolour, and Virginica) from their petal and sepal
length and width.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality-reduction technique that 
is often used to transform a high-dimensional dataset into a smaller-dimensional
subspace prior to running a machine learning algorithm on the data.
1. Reducing the dimensionality of the dataset reduces the size of the space on
which k-nearest-neighbors (kNN) must calculate distance, which improve the performance of kNN.

The simplest possible classifier is the nearest neighbor.
The principle behind nearest neighbor methods is to find a predefined number of
training samples closest in distance to the new point, and predict the label from these.

Model Evaluation - how do we know that our predictor/prediction is good?
